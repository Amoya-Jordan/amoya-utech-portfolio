    <!-- Chapter 4 -->
    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 4 – Achieve Your Goals</h2>
      <p>This chapter taught me that goals are not just about getting what you want, but about who you become while working for them. Writing goals down makes them real, and breaking big goals into smaller ones prevents overwhelm.</p>
      <p><strong>My Alignment:</strong> In my life, I need to stop “going with the flow” in university and actually write down where I want to be in a few years. The process of chasing my goals will shape me into a stronger person.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Chapter 5 -->
    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 5 – The Proper Use of Time</h2>
      <p>This chapter emphasizes using time wisely: you either feel the pain of discipline now or the pain of regret later. Every day offers many options, but only one best option moves you closer to your goals.</p>
      <p><strong>My Alignment:</strong> For me, this means I can’t keep saying I don’t have time. If something is important, I have to make time for it.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Chapter 6 -->
    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 6 – Surround Yourself With the Best People</h2>
      <p>The people around you affect your future. You must ask if your friends are helping you grow or holding you back. It’s not about cutting everyone off, but being honest about who pushes you to be better.</p>
      <p><strong>My Alignment:</strong> In my life, especially being in a male-dominated field, I need to surround myself with ambitious and positive people so I can keep growing.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Chapter 7 -->
    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 7 – Be a Life-Long Learner</h2>
      <p>Learning doesn’t stop after school. School helps you earn money, but self-education builds real success. Reading, learning from others, and reflecting on mistakes all help you grow.</p>
      <p><strong>My Alignment:</strong> For me, this means I can’t just rely on my classes. If I want to stand out, I have to keep learning on my own.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Overall Reflection -->
    <section>
      <h2>Overall Reflection</h2>
      <p>These chapters taught me that my life is my responsibility. If I want better results, I must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set goals</li>
        <li>Manage my time</li>
        <li>Choose the right people</li>
        <li>Keep learning</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Success doesn’t just happen; you must be intentional about it.</p>
