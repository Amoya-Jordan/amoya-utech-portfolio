      <h3>My Favourite AI Business Idea – Adaptive Learning Systems</h3>
      <p>
        My favourite AI business idea from the article is AI-based adaptive learning systems. I chose this one because I’m a university student, and I know how difficult some subjects can be. An adaptive learning system would adjust to how I learn instead of giving everyone the same lessons. If I’m struggling with something like coding or statistics, it would give me more practice. If I understand a topic, it would move me ahead. It’s basically like having a personal tutor anytime I need help.
      </p>
      <p>
        This would be especially helpful for me as a young Black woman studying in a male-dominated field. Sometimes there’s pressure to keep up, and having a system that supports my learning at my own pace would build confidence. It could also help students who can’t afford private tutoring, making education more accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there are ethical concerns. These systems collect a lot of personal data, so privacy and security are important. There’s also the risk of bias if the AI isn’t trained properly. To solve this, companies should protect user data, test for bias, and make sure human teachers are still involved.

      <h3>Duolingo Example</h3>
      <p>
        A real example of adaptive learning is <strong>Duolingo</strong>. It adjusts lessons based on how well you’re doing, making education more personal, supportive, and effective.
